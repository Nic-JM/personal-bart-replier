"OK, so we'll grab lifts then. Jayde has offered to have us stay at her too but think easier to stick to Stellies",yeah don't think there will be enough space with everyone staying over in Cape Town so I will definitely come back
And he's not here to talk about it,he with Kelly
I'm assuming it's easier for you not to join us in Blouberg cos of Faith and Nala?,I think I should be able to still
I know!! And they did a hike with friends and then played padel in the afternoon,very nice... so is he coming back tonight?
https://za.rapid.studio/site/hardcover-photobooks?srsltid=AfmBOoqklVm8IZgPZfRLdK3cTXhISugooYO_BM2OYO2NKG6mApcE7lGe,Looks lekker. I like this one
Just out of interest...,"Yes that’s still an option. The only thing is the reviews for lift weren’t absolutely amazing, but I guess it isn’t for any airlines"
"How's it going on your dbl meds? I forgot to ask.
Also, pls tell me what I owe you for them",Think there’s still an adjustment period with them so I don’t feel anything just yet. Do you guys pay for that ?
Spoke to Dad about you guys thinking about roadtripping up in Dec with Nala. He wasn't concerned at all,"Ok cool, glad to hear"
Nb pudo,Got it right now thanks mom !
Missing you guys a lot!! Can't wait to see you in Stellies ,Really looking forward to it!
Ideas for a gift for Faith?,"She’s still not really wanting anything yet, will give it a think about"
I cleaned Dob and it died  going to order a new one,Oh no
Thought of you...,That’s actually a pretty cool Lego
"Cash still a better gift for Faith tho, correct?",Yes. Spoke to her about it and yep
Can't get Nala just right,This one’s actually a pretty good representation 
Photo,Thank you mom
"This is all I can see.
Are you on a community group there at all?",Unfortunately not no
Pls send pic of your Irish passport,Do I have it?
Is your power back on?,Yes thankfully
From Spain. But I've got the actual passport,So what do I have? A copy of it?
"I have 2pm on Thursday 
2pm and 4pm on Friday","Ok cool, I’ll do 2pm on Thursday. Thank you so much"
Thank for inviting me. Was a blast. The wines from Hanco,Of course. Please tell him I said thank you
"Happy Birthday Nic! Wow, 21 years! Hope you have a great day and have some fun celebrations planned. Sorry I won’t be able to join you next weekend, but sure you’re going to have a great time!",Thanks so much Janine !
We going to boschendal at 1 tomorrow then some drinks after. Dan said you were busy so don’t stress if you can’t make it,Thanks for the invite Kevin. Yeah sorry I have and exam Monday and proj hand in on Sunday so not gonna be able to make it. I’ll drop off a present sometime next week that works for you
Uh sorry we found someone else,No stress 
I’m keen to go out and play pádel after tho,Yeah I’m down but don’t think Dan will be
We might do a braai after if you also keen for that but that’s going to be kinda on the day planning,Ok sick sounds good
You wanna come by my place at like 2:15 or you gonna go straight there?,Im keen for that. Faith is driving so she’ll drive us and whoever else needs a lift
"Kiara, some mates from Eng and possibly Chris. But Chris being Chris is not giving me a straight answer",Sick
I think we’re good,Ok then maybe meet you there?
"Hey dude how you doing? Yeah I'm gonna go, I have a biochemistry practical at 10 anyways so might as well go to class and I'll gym in between",Yeah good thanks and you? not in the mood for class but also gonna go. See you there 
Please tell me you're subdef looks like this. Cause if so then I finally had my eureka moment and I know what to do ,"Before you call parse_type, you should check if it is a type first"
Photo,Yes exactly that
Then what is type token for?,It’s pretty irrelevant lol
Still need to write it but assumes you would check here if the toke.type you give it is tok_boolean or tok_integer,You don’t have to do it for all of them
Yeah I think you can either do it ther le or manually,Yeah
"Is this fine for parse factor? Also what do I put instead of tok_index and tok_arglist as those are obviously not tokens? How do I check that out need to parse_index for example? Also if you've got other stuff you need to do its super chilled I don't expect you to take time out of other stuff, please don't take time out of other stuff if you can't, but thanks so much for the help so far.",Yeah but you don’t need parse_num
"Is this fine for parse factor? Also what do I put instead of tok_index and tok_arglist as those are obviously not tokens? How do I check that out need to parse_index for example? Also if you've got other stuff you need to do its super chilled I don't expect you to take time out of other stuff, please don't take time out of other stuff if you can't, but thanks so much for the help so far.",The tokens at the beginning of arglist
"Thanks so much for the help, just don't have time to properly bugfix this week's been so hectic, really really appreciate it","Yeah of course bro, any time"
"Hey man, I'm hella sick, started coughing up blood this morning so probably not a good idea to come to class, could you please let me know if I miss anything important in comp Sci?","Shit bro, that sounds horrible. I’m not going in to class today"
"Only thing to be carefully about is fgets(array you want to write to, max number of characters you want to be able to put in that array, file) will overwrite anything in that array, so you need to process one line at a time",Oh shit okay
Aight turns out file stuff is actually super easy,Thank you bro 
"Yo, what does your parse expr look like with type checking? I'm 99% sure I'm doing it right but I'm a bit shady on a few things ",I’m not doing type checking lol
You made the right decision,Ok I’m glad 
So did you just do the symbol and hashtable then?,Yeah yeah
Haven't done anything else since yesterday  cycled to somerset west and went shopping for my dance tonight so haven't really had time,"Why did you cycle there  that’s insanely impressive, don’t think I could make it that far"
You need to call parse type (which you already are in your code above expect id) and give it a pointer to a type variable and set its type in there,Ooookay yes that makes sense. Thanks man 
"No worries dude, shout if you need more help","Also feel free to ask me questions, made it decently far now"
Ah thanks dude ,How was it?
"I'm doing it now, I'll let you know, sorry haven't been by my phone",Actually don’t worry about that. I’ve deciding I’m just not gonna do them
Dude my codegen got fucked,Shit man that sucks
"Just need a 75 average for the a1 and a2 and do okay in the assembly tuts and I'll be fine, but gonna be close",You can definitely do that I I’m you’ll be more than fine
I'm just done with this class,Bro
"Dunno, the only comments is style check stuff",Oh what. What’d you get for codegen?
"If I look at the test cases half of the stuff is left blank, so either that means that they didn't mark it or I got 0 but it worked for me on the narga computers so I don't understand",Maybe it was an issue on there part
"Idk maybe, thing is I just don't have the energy to argue with them",Fair enough
How'd yours go?,Yeah mine was decent
I'll see when the test cases come out and I'll test it,Good idea
"Not too bad, did a fair bit of playing around with assembly over the weekend so getting the hang of it. Just looked at tut 6 and 7, 7 will be easy but 6 is gonna take some thinking, won't be too bad tho I don't think",Yeah I’ve mostly done 6. Does take a lot of thinking but nothing horrible
Btw I'm gonna go grab some ice cream at 5:30 for my birthday if you'd like to join :) and you can tell mia and Adrian and everyone else that they're more than welcome to join,"Oh for sureeee, that’ll be sick. I’ll be there"
Btw I'm gonna go grab some ice cream at 5:30 for my birthday if you'd like to join :) and you can tell mia and Adrian and everyone else that they're more than welcome to join,Will do. I don’t have all of their numbers but will message dylan
Yeah yeah  I'm a fossil,Happy birthday man 
"Awe sick, I'll send you a pin in a bit",Cool cool
Btw you're more than welcome to invite your girlfriend,Thanks bro ! She’s unfortunately she’s grafting her comp sci project that’s due on Wednesday so she’s won’t be able to make
1:28,Okay sick yeah that makes sense
Yours work 100% now?,Nah haven’t had much time to work on it sadly
We gonna grind through a lot this afternoon,Agreed
It just takes so much thinking to do anything  ,Dude it sucks. I don’t have it in me
How's the a1 mark looking?,Yeah pretty much exactly what I was expecting. Got 79
"Nah almost, 95 but I'll take it ",Dammmmn insane bro
"Dude idk how I'm already this bored, class ended two days ago",I feel you 
You go to gym yet today?,Nah rest day today sorry. What you hitting?
"Ah all good, I'm doing some chest and shoulders",Nice
"I'm just craving social time ngl  ever since I actually started talking to people I feel so shit when I'm not doing it. Anyways if you guys ever go out or do anything and you got an extra spot lemme know, would be sick",100% bro I definitely will. I don’t think I’m going to be doing much for the next bit with exams though 
"Awe thanks my g, yeah I get you same, it's gonna be a tough few weeks ",For real
"Pretty good, don't need any crazy marks luckily but still gonna do my best, only start next Wednesday too so I've got time",Yeah same. Definitely makes it easier knowing you don’t need any crazy marks for A2’s
"Pretty well, waiting for compsci so just kinda chilling for now",Ok nice
You?,I’m studying for economics and data science but they a while a way so I have a lot of time
Btw I'm gonna go chill by the dam for a but to get some sun if you wanna join,"Ah thanks man, sorry I didn’t see the message, was busy yesterday. Hope the dam was nice. We should hit another gym session together at some point soon"
"Ah it's all good dude no stress, had a good time. Yeah for sure that sounds sick, how about tomorrow? I'm happy to train anything","Ah sorry dude, I’m really busy the next few days. How about Saturday?"
"Yoo, how'd the move go?",Yoh dude. Moving sucks 
Just wanted to ask if you know what's going on with comp Sci marks,Why what’s up with yours? Can’t you see yours?
My results tab doesn't show the A2 marks,Have you checked sun student?
How I passed this module with my project going the way it did I'll never know but fuck it I ain't asking questions,Yeah dude you’re insane
"Started talking to this girl, who I'm still convinced is just a figment of my imagination  and that's just been great, got my new violin so that's super exciting, and gyms going great as well, really nothing to complain about",Hell yeah man
How about you?,Yeah been decent. Got my wisdom teeth out so haven’t been able to do much 
"Thanks for the birthday invite btw, appreciate it","Of course man, hope you can make it"
"My girlfriend, met her early December and things have been going really really well :)",Hell yeah man. She’s very welcome to come to my 21st
"But we have to go gym sometime, you back in stellies yet?",Yes yes
"Yep, got a bit lazy in the beginning of the year but been back at it for like 2 weeks or so",Valid same
"Hey dude, I'll be there at around 6 tonight if that's chilled, just have something on, but can't wait it's gonna be great",Sounds good brother. See you then. Looking forward to seeing you man
"My man, thank you so much for last night it was so fun, we definitely gotta make plans throughout the year.
I'll organize supper at my place sometimes soon
Hope your week goes well","Of course man, thank you so much for coming and bringing Hannah, she really seems lekker by the way. We must definitely do something soon"
"Hey Nick. Thanks again for inviting us to your 21st. It was a privilege to be invited and to share it with you and your family. I hope you didn’t feel too bad today. When you showed me your stand for the washing machine, I thought of the dustbin I did in our kitchen. Maybe this video will help with an idea for your wash basket. Have a good week and yell if I can help with advice.","Thanks so much for coming Alec, I really enjoyed having you guys here. Will definitely do something like that, it’s a great idea. I’ll message you if I have any questions and if not I’ll show it to you when it’s finished."
"Hi Nicholas

Thanks for your message & offer to foster for FLAR, please could we ask a few questions:

Where do you live?

Would you be able to collect supplies from us (Tamboerskloof or Rondebosch whichever is closer) or take the cat to Rondebosch Vet for their vaccinations or should they need medical attention.

We supply everything you need in terms of litter, food & medical treatment.",We live in newinbosch security estate which is just outside of stellenbosch
Oh dear That's a bit far for us. We usually only take fosters in S Suburbs & CBD areas but  will keep you in mind if there is a longterm adult foster,Oh no :( 
Do yk when we are getting our stats marks,Great timing for the question 
Ye im gonna,You king
I only worked a little bit  i was hella tired last night,Valid
She said it’s free,Ohhhhhh hell yeah
Theres a really pretty girl here damn,Go for her luke
Probably  the slides dont explain too well,Im gonna do that this weekend
Short with short curly black hair,Ermmmmm
,Haha
Im gonna do that this weekend,Yeah I’m gonna do it now
Im loaded with caffeine tho cuz i wanna grind compsci tonight,Caffeine past 15:00 is wild behaviour luke
Hahaha was it the assertion error?,Nah lol
We can set up the github repo and try to figure out who the fuck that guy is throughout the week,Ok sick 
Like today?,Yeah
Actually you can come to mine. The Jean Luc guy isnt here but he said we should just keep him updated,Ok sick
Actually you can come to mine. The Jean Luc guy isnt here but he said we should just keep him updated,Where is he?
"Oh yeah btw when you get here, please just park on the side of the road and not the driveway",Cool
Photo,You missed your chance
Make sure the <> inclusions are above the “” inclusions,…
…,They are
I thought codegen.c had a spelling mistake but it doesnt,Does that not mean that there is an error in it then?
Index is optional but should always be followed by gets,Makes sense thanks luke
Sorry that i couldn’t help,Nah nah no stress you did
Im so behind with data science im gonna do that shit now,Valid
I failed a small amount of test cases too,"Same, and I don’t know how… I tested mine pretty thoroughly"
When u going,Just got here
Idk people are stupid,I agree luke
Im gonna use the tht tomorrow to start tho,Fairs
Ill see u at the tut,You gonna come to my venue??
What time you going,What time you going
Ah sorry man havent worked on it again,Nah no stress was just curious
The proofs yes but for example that Prediction Interval for simple linear regression,There’s only one proof isn’t there? The bias variance one? Or did I miss one ?
But i dont think we need to explicitly memorise the mathematical formulas… idk it doesnt seem like something we’d be assessed on since we’re not doing math  yk,I’m hoping not. I’m gonna learn the confidence interval formula… as in y +- Z… just incase she asks what the general confidence interval is
"Like this for example 
Do you think theres a point in memorising it?",I’m gonna learn that one but I doubt she’ll ask
You gymming today??,Yes bb
Ok but im not gonna be there @ 3,Me neither
Are you going to compsci today?,What you gonna do?
Idk  i wanna study for OR but also not risk missing a test or something,I doubt there’ll be a test to be honest
Im at ginos now,Naughty naughty
You doing good mentally tho?,Yeah in kind of an is what it is mind set so surviving lol
Hello sorry for only answering now,No stress pookie
And you cant open the subroutine after inserting??,As in you can’t open a subroutine with the same name if something you’ve inserted?
Ive been doing ONLY compsci this whole recess,Making notes?
For where tho,What you mean?
To show formulas??,We have to write a report
Hell no ,Ive barely touched the theory
I just woke up give me a minute,No rush
And the type checking too???,Hell no
Ive implemented it but only pass 20/90 test cases lol,That could still be a good few percentages overall
I went on valgrind and i have 5000 bytes of lost memory,How do you do that?
I went on valgrind and i have 5000 bytes of lost memory,I assume from type checking though?
Uhhhh,Nah no stress I’m not gonna do it
"Yeaaahhh but it’s because of the symbol table not clearing properly… most of it comes from the expect_id() thing, but I thought ht_free is supposed to clear that.
Ive tried modifying it sm but nothing works",Honestly I don’t think it’ll matter too much surely ?
Im gonna go now too,Valid decision
Good luck with your test tomorrow,Thanks luke
But we will only be able to see our marks tomorrow at the practice,So we have to go in to the prac?
Yku going to gym today?,I’m not sure
Yku going to gym today?,You?
Have you tried adding interaction terms maybe?,"im gonna do that now, just basically figuring out what the main base should be if that makes sense"
Im pretty sure you can leave out the other quarters but then the prediction and other info will only be viable for the 4th quarter of the year,Did this help 
Did this help ,"sort of, still trying to figure it out, but thank you. gonna do some research and then let you know"
Hahaha no im behind on work,Samsies
Like finding relationships between variables and stuff,I think the data is purposely not that well related
We only allowed to have 5 visualisations so obviously each one has to be pretty unique,Yeah I don’t really get how we could summarise majority of the work with only 5 graphs
I just finished them. I can repay you now if you want.,How’d you do it?
So does the printing work now?,Are you still gonna include arrays ?
I didnt help,You did bb
I just forgot to add a ;,Oh let me try
This is my jasmin for it if it helps,Ah dude I have 1 different thing to you
I spoke to albert today and he said he gave up on the project. His symbol table doesnt work and he doesnt have time to do codegen cuz of stats,"Honestly there isn’t that much for stats, I don’t know why people not doing project"
Thats such bad timing,I know dude
We’ll have a lot more afterwards,Okay yeah sounds good. I’m very down
Feel like math is more important,Fair enough
Are you planning on going?,Was basing my decision off of you
Ill let you know closer to the time,Ok cool cool
I think imma go,The message didn’t come through
Tf you mean no way  you were considering it just like an hour ago,No as in I would of come but somehow the message didn’t show up as a notification
What do you wanna know,Question about heteroscedacity
"Wait correct me if im wrong, if this is funnel shaped then it’s violation of linearity right?",No I think as long as it’s any non constant shape I think 
Have you tried doing weighted least squares regression yet?,"I haven’t yet, was focusing on other stuff for a bit"
"The thing is, i feel like it should really just have that tendency of bouncing around 0",Yeah that’s what I was thinking
Im doing gradient boosting rn and it seems very promising,Oh damn I’ll have to look to see what that is
Is that tail bad?,That’s a very normal distribution
Why is overleaf broken,If your WiFi struggles slightly it breaks
Can you compile?,I struggled with that for so long 
We can jump in and try to fix it when he thinks we’re submitting,Very valid
"Even though it might not effect sales, it’s much better than that correlation table tbh",Ok yeah I’ll add it
Sorry for not coming  I was late because something came up,I don’t forgive you
You can just send it on discord,But as in must I send it as an html or notebook. I’m assuming notebook
I have a problem,What??????
So should I ask him to write it? ,Yes
Yes notebook please,Ok sending now. Discord took forever to update
Where u,WiFi naughty
I dont know about that Nicholas   i feel like the rating is there for a reason. We are supposed to say why we gave a low rating so giving an explanation might mean they will be more leanient with the marks yk,Obviously he doesnt deserve a 1 but I mean… an 8?
"Like the lack of references in his sections, how simple his graphs are, etc.",Fair enough
Obviously he doesnt deserve a 1 but I mean… an 8?,He definitely doesn’t deserve an 8 but I don’t know
Oh ,Have you a heart attack
Im halfway through vector calculus,How long did that take you?
It’s a lot of revision from math 214 with some added stuff for vectors so it’s quite easy to grasp,Ok nice
Group 4  It’s not too great so im kinda optimistic for ours,Same lol
A day,Very nice
But anyway im not going either,Extremely valid
im not in the mood for this bullshit im ngl,Couldn’t agree more
Im just doing data science rn,Is it just me or does it take forever to get through everything
Yeah and it’s also surprisingly advanced content  it’s pretty hard maths,I think it’s gonna be really hard to remember everything
Thank you for your effort,No thank you pookie
"Much better than I expected, but she marked very strictly",Yeah agreed for sure
Nah im pretty sure it did much better than I or jean couldve done,Nah you would have killed it
Especially judging by that project I had to mark gahdayum,Yeah I honestly think we could have been the highest ranked group
Eh it’s alright  ive been having bad health problems so it’s kinda interrupting my studies annoyingly. Hopefully i dont die halfway through exams lol,Oh what
Digestive issues and pain and allat. But i think it mostly stems from anxiety  Idk. It sucks,Shit man I’m sorry about that
Hby? How was stats?,Bro. The 245 A2 was horrible. I could fail but honestly don’t really mind
Im sure you’ll do fine though. Maybe you’ll get exactly 50 like Albert last semester,"That is, if you wanna pass "
Really?? Shit nicholas  Yeah all the effort and stuff put into the work we do only to wonder if we pass is crazy,Bro I know 
Im sure you’ll do fine though. Maybe you’ll get exactly 50 like Albert last semester,There’s definitely a chance I scrape through with a 50
"That is, if you wanna pass ",I actually would kind of be happy with failing it
Ik it sounds weird to say this out of the blue but i have a lot of respect for you and the way you go about life,Oh damn luke that’s really nice. Thank you bro. Definitely feel the same way about you
Will definitely be working on projects with you,For sure broski. I definitely want to do one of the kaggle competitions in the holidays with you
Just wanna say I hope you have a good holiday and all that,Thanks man you too
Ye for like 3 seconds,As in you left quick after writing?
And you,Yeah I left quick
"Imagine that your friend is celebrating his bday with you and a group of other friends at a music festival. You want to take Faith with you and she’ll be the only girl there. You cant order an uber, so one of you will have to be designated driver, which means someone cant drink. 
Faith offers and says she will be the designated driver. Will you be comfortable with that happening, wrt the etiquette of it? Like letting her take the responsibility of it all?",So just answer as if this is really happening to you

Faith offers and says she will be the designated driver. Will you be comfortable with that happening, wrt the etiquette of it? Like letting her take the responsibility of it all?",Yeah I would
Like it felt very “come with us so you can lift” yk,Damn
What happened with the brother thing?,They not doing masters anymore
Eish sorry man,Nah no stress
You probably already got a solution but if you’re still looking I recommend going on facebook marketplace to find the privately listed places,Yeah been keeping my eye open on pretty much everything. Trying to get a place where the lease starts in feb
Yessir are you done with all your exams and all that,yessirrr
Ok Nick. Idk im really busy - my hours are from 11-11 everyday so it’s really hard,Ohhhh sorry for some reason I thought it was done today

Ok Nick. Idk im really busy - my hours are from 11-11 everyday so it’s really hard,That’s insane dude. How you feeling?
Hey Nick. Thanks for the invite. Just wanna ask how did your results go? I assume you passed everything?,No problem luke
Hey Nick. Thanks for the invite. Just wanna ask how did your results go? I assume you passed everything?,Yeah I did thankfully 
Took unnecessarily long cuz i literally just had to ask them to add economics to my acc,Ohh yeah fair
Why did you go?,Literally got deregistered from data science
Did you find econ classes useful or nah,So no not at all
"Hey nick
Really sorry to so this but i cant make it to your party. I will have to speak to you about it next week but for now i hope you understand  Im sorry for the late notice. If theres anything you paid for on my behalf ill be sure to repay it","Of course I understand man, don’t even have to explain why. Sorry you couldn’t make it, hope everything is good"
Just wanna ask how your A1s and projects and all that are looking for the next few weeks,I’m chilled for the next 2 weeks
Wanna get a beer with you at some point,Sick
And also Ross and Dylan,Very keen
Nick I think maybe only you and me should go for the beers  I wanna talk to you about work  and projects  and building a cv,im keen brother
Cuz this time im not bartending lol,valid... I could never
The guy i was talkin to was being a nuisance,What was he saying??
Also ive been grinding the tutorials again and i can tell why it benefits you to kinda just memorise the questions and answers lmao,Yeah exactly
Did u study from the textbook too or did u go to class,Went to class for 214
Also good luck with ur A1 today mr mostert,Thanks brother
What?,The book for ecos 214
How did it go,not too bad thankfully
"Hi Nicholas. Thank you for being available to feed our cats  is R100 a day okay? If so, would you prefer cash or EFT? Thanks, Nicola","Hi Nicola, I’m really happy to do it for free :)"
"Absolutely not 
Please let me know when would be a convenient time for you and your mom to pop in  we leave Tuesday morning",Is it fine if I let you know when we can come in tmrw evening?
"Hi Nicholas. Hope you’re feeling okay and that your recovery is going well. Just to let you know that we decided to leave the scullery door open and give the boys  access to the house (just closed some upstairs rooms). Also, we noticed ants on the windowsill so used chalk to hopefully deter them. The chalk is in the dustbin with the cat food if you need to use it ","Hi Nicola, recovery is going well thanks. I’m going there in the next 20 minutes so will update you about the ants "
"Hi Nicholas. Hope you are enjoying your holidays. Just want to check that you’re okay with the feeding…if boys are doing okay, you can reduce to every second day ",Hi Nicola. Everything is going well… all the cats seem happy :)
Merry Christmas Nicholas!! Thank you for everything you’re doing for our boys ,Merry Christmas to you too It’s been a pleasure
"Thank you for looking after Clover, Guinness and Murphy - they all look so well and happy ",I’m so glad. It really was a pleasure to look after them :)
"Hi Dan and Nic, looking forward to seeing you on Sunday. Do you each want to bring a friend along...or are just the 4 of us meeting for lunch?",Not too sure about Dan but I won’t bring a friend. Looking forward to seeing you guys too
Great Nic. Presume you have chosen a restaurant?,Yes I have. I’ll drive all of us from our place to the restaurant 
Hi Nic. Your Mom tells me you will be in Dunvegan around 9th July. Do you travel with only carry on luggage?,"Hi nana, yes I’ll be in joburg around the 9th or 10th. I’ll bring a big suitcase with me this time instead of just carry on luggage. When are you planning on being in joburg? Around that time too?"
"Great Nic. I had a Swiss knife confiscated,  because I had forgotten it in my carry on luggage. A very nice lady at Safair check in said she would keep it for me until someone with luggage to put in the hold made contact with her. I will send you her name and number, so you can contact her closer to the time. She works shift, so you would need to contact her a few days before you go. Are you OK with doing that for me? If so I will send you her name and number...and phone her myself. ","I’ll happily do that, is it at the airport in joburg??"
"Thought it best if you make contact with each other. She is not on duty, but will tell you from whom at check-in to collect my Swiss Knife. Thanks Nic...hope it all works out",...so that you can pack it in your suitcase before checking that case in.
One tired little girl...it has been a busy day!,Very cute. Excited to meet her 
"Hi Nic...super seeing you and Faith! Are you back in Stellenbosch? The girl I spoke to you about is Erin Le Roux ( 1st year student B. COM?). She, like Juliette Armitage, (3rd year student) are originally from Volksrust/Wakkerstroom. They may not know each other...and JuJu is a party girl...Erin is not. Will send more details when I have them ...her Mom said she will send me her address. She is also in private accom.","Thank you to both of you, you and Faith, for agreeing to make contact with her. "

"Great Nic...even though it did not meet your expectations, it did confirm  what you do NOT want to do. Sure you will get around to contacting Erin. I think she is very lonely. She told her Mom she had not heard from you. Hope I have not burdened you guys with a needy person!!!","Faith just messaged her, will let you know how it goes."
Well done on your excellent marks Nic .... top 15 per cent! Did Erin ever respond to Faith's reaching out to her?,"Sorry for not responding, this semester has been very busy. Thank you, was very cool to hear about it. I also got another award for being in the top 5% of the economics faculty. Erin did respond and her and faith have been talking."
"Awesome Nic
.so proud of you. Well done. Combination of effort and brains. Yes I have a really wonder day planned. Breakfast with Gapu,Morning tea with two other Leo girl friends ( annual event) Croquet at Thyme Out. And finally drinks and snacks at our home...Westover.",Sounds great . Hope it’s gone great

I'm not really sure where I'm at yet but thought it would be best for you to know especially when looking for accommodation. This is pretty late and I'm sorry about that but it might be best for you to also start looking at accommodation without me for now. Maybe I can come over to your place later or you to mine to discuss it more in person if that works for you?",Okay yeah of course.

Hi Nic. Just wanted to say hello.  Also wanted to say that I have been absent from communication with you and attention for the last months. Just so busy you see. I suppose I also think that you are strong and capable and can stand a bit of neglect. But I hope to give you more coms from now. No need to respond or feel pressure. Love you boy. D,"No stress, I’ve also been pretty absent. I didn’t think anything of it, I know you’re super busy. How’s work been? Love you too dad"
Hi Nic. Hope you are good. Just a reminder that it is mother's day tomorrow. Probably a good idea to phone mom and to wish her. Love you,I will!
Hi Nic. Good luck for your exam. Let us know how it went.,Thanks dad. Went okay for not having studied
Hi Nic. Wishing you all the best for mathsstats tomorrow. ,Thanks dad
Hi Nic. Mom and I are going out tonight. I am going to take a nap now. Can I phone you tomorrow?,Yep that works  enjoy

" sorry to hear that. Keep your chin up though. As said before, if you find it hard then others harder.when are you writing the last one?",Writing on the 24th. Apparently it’s an easier exam

I have been watching a series on Netflix called Kleo. It's a little off the wall but fun. Well made and good acting. Give the  1st episode a try,I’ll give it a go and let you know
"Hey Nic. Congratulations about  your achievement. Sounds fantastic. Let us know what that all means practically. Let's chat on the weekend and we can catch up and discuss this. As previously discussed, any discount obtained by you for tuition will be given to you. Love dad","Thank you dad!! I think it works out to around R12000 off of uni fees for the next payment to the uni, but not entirely sure. Hope works been going well"
A quietish day but because I rode with Kevin this morning my energy started waying after 2pm. Eventually went home. The first few times are going to be rough. What did you write and when will you get youtlr marks,Is work still busy recently ? Or relatively quiet? 
Hi Nic. How are your feeling?,Took the last two days chilled so definitely feeling more relaxed. How’re you doing?
Hi Nic. Did I pay you last month?,Yes you did. Why?
Good luck for today. Wishing you a fair paper. Let us know,Thanks dad
Photo,Is it a new movie?
10cm maybe.,Measures it and yes it is 10cm
The question is how much you need get the machine closer to the wall to get the door closed. May only 2cm? My concern Nic is that you would need to raise the machine quite a lot to get it over the tap. This must be resolved by a plumber i think. Maybe add an extension against the wall (elbow joint) to lift the tap above the machine?,Would have to lift it probably 30cm up. But that work because we want a cupboard/storage thing underneath to keep our bathroom stuff
Hi boy. Sorry I was abrupt with you earlier. Just had a busy day.  I was not pissed off with you at all. Chat tomorrow,"No stress dad, knew you weren’t mad at me. Thanks for helping me sort this out"

How is Nala?,That’s good that you’re taking care of yourself. How’s the new employee? Faith is under a lot of pressure at the moment so she’s quite stressed. Nala is growing super fast and is full of energy but she still very sweet
"Hi Nic. Daniella started on Monday. I have very little contact with her but my feedback from Jessica is good and she is pleasant.

Can't wait to meet Nala.",Yes really looking forward to having you guys here. Is she not going to work at all in that time?

And no washing machine
All of which could complicate your life","But it is a very good price
But yes I agree"
"I also don't see cupboard space
You spend a lot of time working where you live and I think you would get depressed here. I don't think it's worth your mental health","I don’t think I will spend a lot of time there this year though
Will spend close to half of the time at faith and then on campus potentially"
"OK, well ask for a video and see what's included
I've left my car there for you guys.","How do you spell Liezel
Like that ?"

Thankfully"
You must still tell me what we owe for meds,Spoilt and weird
This is all I can see.,Thankfully they are running the generator most of the time
Power back on???,Unfortunately not no. But they’ve had the generator on all day so we’ve had power. It’s just the worry of it switching off at any time brings uncertainty
Yebo. On your phone,"I don’t seem to have it any more for some reason

Sawubona,Who’s this?
Qiniso,I think you have the wrong number sorry

"Kiara, some mates from Eng and possibly Chris. But Chris being Chris is not giving me a straight answer",Would be simpler

All I’m saying is that if you don’t match that energy. Imma be disappointed,We here
I’m keen to do the braai tomorrow,Sorry kev I’m not feeling to good so might not be able to make it
Cool thanks man,"It’s make testparser
Or something along those lines
It says it in the make file"
Oh yeah I'm dumb thanks,Nah no stress lol
Forgot it was the test one,I did that too
"Oh okay yeah 100%
But I've got the general concept? ","Yes yes
You do"
"About time 
You're a life saver","No wait
No
Token.type won’t return type
It would return tok_int or tok_boolean
If if it’s either of those then you call it"
"Then what is type token for?
But I get what you mean
Yeah I think you can either do it ther le or manually",I think I only did for type and expr
"My head hurts, but I think I'm getting there, was just overcomplicating it ","So ( I think
Tok_lpar"
"If I don't call expect_id(), which they say isn't necessary for the parser in the spec, do I need to get_token() every time there's and <id> or not? Because expect_id() had get_token() in it but I'm not calling it.",Yeah you call expect(TOK_ID) instead of it
"Yo, what does your parse expr look like with type checking? I'm 99% sure I'm doing it right but I'm a bit shady on a few things ","Got too busy of a schedule… so decided to leave it out because we don’t need it for the last hand in
How’s it going?"
"Painfully 
You made the right decision","That part wasn’t too bad
How’d you find it?"
"By fat the easiest one for me so far
Because the documentation amd skeleton code is actually good ","Could you send the style checker your used for the last hand in?
I tried to download the one from SUNLearn but it doesn’t seem to be working"
"I'm using the one from sunlearn
Ill send it to you",Thank you 
"But it reports a bunch or false stuff  I mostly just use it to check for whitespaces
I can email it to you?",Yeah of course
Aight I'll do it now,"Thank Sebastien 
No rush though"
"Okay it sent, lemme know if it works","Just got it 
Thanks bro"
Please call me if they start a tut test ,Ok cool I will
You coming to comp Sci ?,"Nah not today weather was putting me off
You there?"
"Yeah I have, I'm super comfortable with the hamming codes and IEEE 764 and boolean algebra stuff, its just the theory I'm worried about I don't really know what to do there
Cause if he asks super detailed stuff I'm probably not gonna remember everything",You back home?
"Yeah, I'm leaving for gym now",On my way too
"Aight I'm here, I'm by the pull-up bars, just lemme know when you here","Just got here
On my way in"
Cool cool,How was comp sci?
"Dude my codegen got fucked
I don't know how
It all worked when I tested it
Did fine in type checking
I'll still probably pass but we gonna have to work for it
Just need a 75 average for the a1 and a2 and do okay in the assembly tuts and I'll be fine, but gonna be close
I'm just done with this class",I wonder why? What were the errors?
"Dunno, the only comments is style check stuff",Same
"But I got 0 for style
Somehow
Even tho I had no errors on the style checker
Worst case I need to redo next year, it won't add anymore time to my studying but it'll just be a pain","Honestly wouldn’t be surprised
Especially if your stuff worked
There’s very little reason why codegen would work for you but not on tests"
"And Willem was pissed this morning, I think he's been getting kak ton of emails
Idk
How'd yours go?",Nothing amazing better what I expected
"Sat down and redid practical 1, just in case you wanted to take a look at it
Actually so mad that I couldn't figure it out during the prac, but now we know","Oh sick thanks man
You going to the tut
?"
Working for me,"Oh Damn
That’s way simpler than I expected it would be"
"Yeah no same, I was expecting to sit there for 2 hours",How the tuts going?
"Not too bad, did a fair bit of playing around with assembly over the weekend so getting the hang of it. Just looked at tut 6 and 7, 7 will be easy but 6 is gonna take some thinking, won't be too bad tho I don't think
Btw I'm gonna go grab some ice cream at 5:30 for my birthday if you'd like to join :) and you can tell mia and Adrian and everyone else that they're more than welcome to join
Ice cream will be on me btw","I obviously don’t know if it’s gonna work
So maybe I’m speaking to early
Is your birthday today?"
"Ah no stress, we're going to a place called Kristen's btw","We on our way

"No worries dude, we gotta grind through this together ","I got half the test cases for binary search
I quickly did it
You want me to send ? Or you done with it?"
"I've got mine working, thanks tho
Yours work 100% now?
I spent an hour trying to debug just to find out my dumbass put a dec instruction instead of inc ",I hate assembly honestly
"Yeahh I get you, we'll get through it tho
I'm gonna head there at 12 already, gonna try get as much done by 5 as possible","Okay awe I’ll actually join you
Just eating quick then I’m gonna go
I’ll see you there"
"Sounds good, see you there","I got tut 6 to work
Mostly

How's the a1 mark looking?,"You?
You get your 100?"
You go to gym yet today?,Well done
"I'm just craving social time ngl  ever since I actually started talking to people I feel so shit when I'm not doing it. Anyways if you guys ever go out or do anything and you got an extra spot lemme know, would be sick",How you feeling for your exams?

"Ah it's all good dude no stress, had a good time. Yeah for sure that sounds sick, how about tomorrow? I'm happy to train anything",I’m also happy to do anything
"Absolute life saver thank you :)
Imma be at the library tommorow and Tuesday if you wanna join",What time you going to the venue?
"Yoo, how'd the move go?
Just wanted to ask if you know what's going on with comp Sci marks
Cause even tho I'm 99.99% sure I don't have an A3 it would be nice to be 100% sure
My results tab doesn't show the A2 marks
Idk I might be dumb
Absolute genius
I'm so dumb
I'll check just now","I did that too
The only reason I knew to check sun student is because of the WhatsApp group"
"But we chilling
How I passed this module with my project going the way it did I'll never know but fuck it I ain't asking questions",You deserved it though. Biggest academic comeback
"Yo dude, how you feeling for next week?","I don’t feel like going through what I did last semester lol

Yeah ive done my planning and read through the first chapter,like ive been working pretty hard on it today and ive only written like 2 lines of code
"Just need to start cosing
Coding","ohhhhh
fair enough"
"Nicholas
Can i give you a call for like 5 mins",Yea
Idk who tf that is,"Me neither
Seems like a smart name low-key
How’d the project go?"
"Hello
For the ReservedWord array right
Do we HAVE to populate it manually? Or can we make a loop function to populate it…","Just ask chat get to do it
But manually
That’s what I did"
U coming to the prac bbg,"Nah lukie pookie
Gonna work from home
Start studying the data science theory
You gonna go???
Are you just working through prac 2?"
No theres a lecture,"Do you have the textbook for data science
So I don’t have to go download it"
"No
She said it’s free
So
Theres a really pretty girl here damn","Do you rate it’s worth it to go through the book?
Or just slides
What she look like"
"And shes wearing a trench coat
With cargos","Doesn’t ring a bell
Have you seen her in other classes?
Grind starts today"
Oh nah she’s definitely not in our classes haha,"Bro
I cannot find the textbook
Like what it’s called
Anywhere"
ISLP,"Oh, that makes sense"
"Hahaha
We getting our projects now","Is she going to explain it in class
?
Now?"
Thinknso,"Fuck
Oops"
"It’s ok
I dont think you’re gonna miss anything
It’s on sunlearn now",How does the project look?
Hard,"Do you know what time the gym opens tmrw?
Cos it’s a public holiday"
No idea,"You look cute bbg
What you hitting?"
"Legs
Im loaded with caffeine tho cuz i wanna grind compsci tonight
So",How’d it go?
"It’s going fine i think??
I finished most of the things that we need done for friday.
I hope
And you","Was going great
Until now
Got an issue that I can’t fix
Have you got comments working
Nevermind
I fixed that shit"
"Hahaha was it the assertion error?
I got that too
Took me forever to fix","Different
I had finished comment a while ago but then tested it again yesterday just to make sure… and it was all fucked
But was an easy fix actually
Also, is she discussing project in class for data science"
"Idk bro
We need to get together to start on the project at some point
Please","Yes I agree
When you thinking?"
Uhhhh what abt tomorrow afternoon?,I finish math stats at 5
"I think our group member is that one white guy that always sits alone
I think… idk tho",The guy I said I was going to ask?
"Yuh
But we need to find out who he is fr tho
Im just theorising","I’m not going to class
So I can do anytime"
"Uh ok im at gym
This rain is kinda off-putting tho","Fr
You still want to do it?
I don’t mind"
Nicholas please just lmk what you think ,"Oh shit my bad pookie
Yeah I agree
I really don’t mind
Any day works for me"
What?,"You used his full name
Was so formal"
Just jn case theres another Jean-Luc,Did he message?
Nope,Imagine he just mizes
"Bro this guy
Maybe hes one of the ppl who didnt make it but he hasnt been removed from sunlearn yet","Could be
Maybe he’s just shy
Will message later today
Not really sure"
Yeaterday ye,"Oh ok fair
I’m probably gonna go the evening"
Why?,So if you want to come too
"Ah okay nice
I have OR tut til 5","You down to go today?
Cause I’m happy to go after that
I just want to make sure it runs on narga
And then submit plagiarism"
"Are you gonna add your chat gpt logs 
Can you forward me the test cases from the group pls
Cuz apparently it’s not on sunlearn","Are you going to go into narga to submit?
Tomorrow"
"Uhhh yete
Yeah
Im just gonna make sure everything is submitted correctly
Probably not gonna stay the whole tut unless theres a chance of a test",So have you submitted already?
Gonna do it later tonight why?,"Just curious with what other people are doing
I’m gonna do the same"
"Yes it is the best strategy i think
I mean if you passed all the test cases there really isn’t anything more you can do","True
I want to fix comments though
How did you do yours?"
Whats wrong with your comments,"Don’t know
I didn’t do the doxygen commenting style"
"Ohhhhhhhh
I thought you mwant the function
Fuck i forgot about that
Doxygen is a documentation software
Like it’s a separate program you use to document stuff
Isk if it’s supposed to be handed in for this submission tho
Like where do we even put that shit","Nah lol there’s nothing else I don’t think
Just the way you do your comments
Like this
Instead of normal"
Oh are you sure?,"No
But I think so"
"Pkay i must have misread
I cant check rn ",Why?
"Im at gym
But ill lyk when im home",Should we meet up on Sunday?
"Definitely sunday 
I have a headache",Naughty naughty
"Ok we can do 17:00 because i have to work on my project
Ill message the other guy to ask if he’s here
Can we meet around your place?
Actually you can come to mine. The Jean Luc guy isnt here but he said we should just keep him updated",Sounds good
"Mom’s bday
But he stays in wilgenhof",How long do you think it’ll take to do the parser
"Oh yeah btw when you get here, please just park on the side of the road and not the driveway",Could I come at 16:45?
Ye you can come whenever,"Awe I’m leaving me now
Awe I’m here
Pookie"
Lady added new data camp courses,Are they useful for the project??
Why did you clog up the narga nicholas,Wasn’t me I swear
Make sure the <> inclusions are above the “” inclusions,"But there’s errors in codegen.c file
The idpropt
Yeah
Oh
We not supposed to?"
"Do this
Trust",I swear
I thought codegen.c had a spelling mistake but it doesnt,"Maybe I haven’t included everything I need to
Let me go try"
"The order of the inclusions are very important so maybe just switch them around a little 
My program works fine
So idk
Maybe dont import codegen
Lmk if you fixed it","Yeah I can’t seem to get it
I’ve imported everything
You legend
Ignore that
I’m such an idiot luke
My stuff was right
I was doing make simplc
Thank you for the help bb"
Howd the project go,"The mark for scanner?
Went really well for me, you?"
Same,But this hand in is a lot more than I expected
Oh fr,"For name…. Is the tok_get only expected if there’s an index?
And if it’s an arglist you don’t need it
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Ok thank you"
No bbg,You at gym pookie?
Am getting ready,Can I call?
"Give me one sec
Sorry
Ill call back now
Wifi acting up
Damn it all
Idk it doesnt make sense to me to give an error of paranthesis expected
Email the lecturer he’s usually very fast with replies
I canr because ive emailed him wayyyy too much by now ",I’m gonna ask on teams
"Good idea
Sorry that i couldn’t help
And that wifi sucks","I’ve found the answer
They were right
Because type is in a square bracket, you have to check if it’s type before you call type"
Can you lmk if you find out which other functions expect the same??,"I don’t think parse_type() does for anything else
I’m doing math stats no but will let you know"
"Im struggling to read these rules imma be real
Im so behind with data science im gonna do that shit now","Why’d you delete a message luke?
Sorry had gone to bed lol"
"All hood
Good
What are you training at gym today","Chest and back
Actually no
Legs maybe
What you doing?"
Back shoulders arms,Did you get the tut test?
"No
Partially",How was parser marks??
Good and yours,Not as good as scanner but pretty good. Lost some marks in style which is annoying
"Yeah same
I failed a small amount of test cases too
Yeahhh 
Idk it’s weird
Wish style wasnt so heavily penalised tho
I lost 5 marks for having a bracket on a new line
Like how is that fair
Also the dont copy and paste ",I don’t think Willem and the guy who made the test script have that much communication
Were you accepted for the shoprite bursary,"No lol
You?"
"I was
Kidding
No","Hehe
We just not good enough"
Idk how good we need to be ,Where you luke
Here,When you going to gym today pookie
"Right now
Im like
So fucking annoyed",Why luje???
"Idk people are stupid
When u going","What did people do
Have you started on comp sci project"
"Ill be there in a few minutes
Train slowly for me",Where you lukie
"Im at home now
Putting on gym clothes
Then coming","Nooooo
Okay I’m gonna miss you
Dylan is here though"
"Okay
Sorry",Nah no stress
"No boss
And you
Im gonna use the tht tomorrow to start tho","When you do I’ll show you a yt video
Will save you time on the hash table
It’s been a life saver"
"It’s such a nice day out
Now we need to sit in a hot room for 3 hours
With a bunch of sweaty anime watchers",That’s my ideal Friday luke
"Yeah sure
Will you reserve a space for me next to you
What time you going","Probably will aim to get there at like 2
To get seats and stuff"
Narga G right,"How far are you?
With comp sci"
"Ah sorry man havent worked on it again
Forgot to push work on narga","Didn’t have a question
You going to gym today?"
"Im considering
Havent done too much chest throughout the week
You?","Ye I’m here
Almost done though"
Bro data science is soooo much work,"Was literally about to message
There’s so much practical work to learn as well
We cooked"
"Yeah it’s crazy how much was covered in a few weeks
But i dont think we need to explicitly memorise the mathematical formulas… idk it doesnt seem like something we’d be assessed on since we’re not doing math  yk
The proofs yes but for example that Prediction Interval for simple linear regression
It’s a massive formula that we basically never used",But other than that I don’t think there’s any point
Like this for example ,"I’m only gonna learn the important ones
Thing that seem relatively important to the topic
And I feel like the formula for calculating the coefficient estimates is pretty important"
"We’re writing a spot test in compsci and ur missing
Im kidding dont actually run","That’s not nice of you luke
Lucky I didn’t see the message until you sent both
Would have had a heart attack"
"I was scared you might be running to class lol
You gymming today??","Here now
Quick session
You?"
Coming in 30mins,I just left
It was a while ago when me and my friends tried to get the most fucked up ones so i cant remember,How hard do you think the practical side is going to be?
Idk man im really uncertain about this whole test lol,"Do you have python code for calculating high leverage points
The one in the prac doesn’t really make sense
Thanks bb
This exam
Could either be fine
Or the death of me
I can’t tell"
Are you going to gym today?,"Do you know the VIF calculation
I don’t feel like learning it"
Nice ill see you there,Do you have extra pens?
"No im gonna go buy some before the test 
Dont wanna run out of inj
Ink**",Same lol
"Im just gonna make some lunch then ill be there
Wont be long",And you going to go to neelsie?
No ill come to venue first,"Why don’t we meet at neelsie?
I need to buy pen and a snack"
"Ok but im not gonna be there @ 3
Probably gonna get there at 15:10",I’ll get there at the same time
"Ok 
Yo im on my way yo campus now","I’ll meet you at the pen store
At the top
Where you"
Are you going to compsci today?,"Mmmmm
I don’t know
When is the homework due? Tmrw?"
"Idk  i wanna study for OR but also not risk missing a test or something
Ill get zero for it anyways but at least there’s attendance
We actually need to ask the compsci professor for all the marks and attendance data then we can make a datsci project out of it ","I feel like because there’s homework for this week that’s the test
I don’t know"
We not writing a spot tear,"That’s good to hear 
How’d you know?"
Yes ma’am,Goodluck pookie
Which venue you writing,"G
You?"
H,How was prac
"Bad
Im at ginos now",How was last night ?
"Bruh compsci is bending me over rn
Im trying to understand all this bitwise map stuff but it just doesnt make sense ","That’s why I’m skipping type checking lol
I’m gonna start on last hand in tmrw probably"
"YOU’RE SKIPPING IT??
How??
Why??","Don’t have time
2 math stats exams
Ecos exam
I’m cooked
Also you don’t need it for last hand in
So no point for me"
"Yeah man that makes a lot of sense…
Shit
You doing good mentally tho?",How’s your work been going??
Yeeee,"The 4th hand in is hard too lol
For comp sci
Also I’m starting on ds proj"
We cooked ,"We should use latex
Overleaf
It goes hard"
"Ive been doing ONLY compsci this whole recess
I get we need to use latex, but what will we use it for
To show formulas??
Ok
That makes sense","My friend who’s doing machine learning is using latex for their data science project reports
Feel like it might get us extra points"
"Nick
Are you doing the compsci hand in now?","Yeah sort of
I’ve finished the symbol table and stuff so gonna go submit today
Let me know when I can call, I have a bit of an issue"
"Ive implemented it but only pass 20/90 test cases lol
So might as well not havw
Piece of shit project","Shit man
I’m so glad I didn’t try"
Bruh,"lol
I saw that
I don’t know if I did it right
And I honestly don’t care
I’m going to bed"
"I wanted to phrase it better but you already saw it
I went on valgrind and i have 5000 bytes of lost memory
Idk what to do
Uhhhh",I’ll figure it out if I need to
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5134891/how-do-i-use-valgrind-to-find-memory-leaks
Thats what i used",Otherwise I’m cooked
"Idk it wasn’t explicitly said in the project spec that we should do it but it’s probably self explanatory lol
But im cooked either way
How tf am i gonna clear 5kb of memory","I don’t think it’s worth it
Game over
Nah but I’m actually going to bed
I’m don’t with the day
Goodluck if you gonna keep working"
"Hahaa goodnight Nicholas
Idk im tired
Im gonna go now too",Hope it went well
Are u coming to compsci,"Hell no
I bet there’s gonna be a test though
I just don’t have it in me"
The datsci marks announcement is such a blue ball,"Wait I didn’t see
Email?"
Just give us the marks ,Or on SUNLearn?
Yeah and sunlesrn announcement,"Oh god
I feel like the marks going to be worse than expected"
"Judging by the general reaction to the test from other people in the class, i agree 
But we will only be able to see our marks tomorrow at the practice
Practical
Yku going to gym today?","I don’t think I will
Tired"
Yes ma’am,I have a data science question
Okay?,"so its pretty clear that there are significantly more sales in the last 3 months for ShopAlot. so I created a col called quarter that then says what quarter of the year we are in.
i dont know if that makes sense"
"Hmmmm that’s quite interesting
Probably because it’s Christmas
Uhhhhh
Im pretty sure you can leave out the other quarters but then the prediction and other info will only be viable for the 4th quarter of the year",yeah it is for christmas
Have you tried adding interaction terms maybe?,"dont know, i calculated it and theres about a 30 rand difference between last quarter and first three. i think it just means people on averge dont spend more, but more people are buying stuff
what work you doing now?"
Math ,What time you getting to data science?
Im already here lol,I’m here
"Bruh
The marks are out ",You going to gym?
Uhhh possibly but only later cuz i have a tut,"Fair enough
I’m going later too
So might see you there"
"Nicole
Are you at the gym?","Yes bb
Don’t have that much left
You here???"
https://youtu.be/fYdcTTH7G8Y?feature=shared,"She’s my favourite influencer
BBQ chicken tots luke
Thank you for the video"
"You’re welcome nicholas
Now you know",Are you gonna go to data science?
"What?
Why would I",Just curious
Hahaha no im behind on work,Seeing if you were going
Ye,"What time
I’m going now"
Same,You gonna come to narga g?
"Yo
Im really struggling to find something meaningful in the data science project rn
Idk why",Wym?
Like finding relationships between variables and stuff,"Yeah I know
I couldn’t get much"
"We only allowed to have 5 visualisations so obviously each one has to be pretty unique
Oh fr?
Yeah it could be","Otherwise everyone would have the same variables
If it was clear that a select few were  related and others not
If that makes sense?"
"Yeah okay
Thats a good point
Facts  we also still have to decide what type of predictive model we’re gonna do
Do the graphs wrt the model also count toward the 5?
Like the resid error graphs",Yeah think so lol
"Yo nick
Where are you with codegen rn","arrays
you?
also could you resend discord"
Im soooo confused,"ive been doing code gen since the week off
took a lot of time to understand
i can help explain?
Missing you pookie"
Are you talking,"I think it’s you
Maybe try on phone
Discord
Sometimes work better
You there?"
Yeah give me a sec,Can’t hear you
"Hey Nicky
 sorry
Were you able to do arrays",Nah lol
I just finished them. I can repay you now if you want.,I just don’t have time to dedicate to it  and for some reason couldn’t get it to work
Rather tell me where your problem is ,"Okay okay
I just need to open up laptop
Give me sec"
Okay,"To be honest
I don’t know where the problem is"
"Yes
Show me your jasmin output thingy","It doesn’t compile if I try print J(0)
I know neg is being called
But don’t know why
And don’t really have to to problem solve"
"Then it will be printed
So whenever the array is called again, it needs to be loaded",I think
"It’s not showing in jasmin tho
Yeah 
This doesnt make ant sense","No wait I got it
Needed this
For gen print
To get the type
But
But does your code work for 
Like making and array equal to array"
"No 
Why","Because isn’t it supposed to?
O also couldn’t get that to work.
And because it gives a set fault which then caps the mark at 50 I though best to just leave arrays lol"
So does the printing work now?,Yes thank you luke for the help 
"I didnt help
If not then ill just make like an exit statement when it happens so that it doesnt segfault
Oh nvm it does work
I just forgot to add a ;
I spoke to albert today and he said he gave up on the project. His symbol table doesnt work and he doesnt have time to do codegen cuz of stats","But I’ve decided I’m just gonna leave it
I should have enough to pass project
Thank for the help luke
But fair enough, this project hand in kinda sucks"
"Hello
Nicholas why you keep calling",I was right behind you luke
"Nicholas
Would you like to come to a braai on the 11th of October
Ill invite Ross too","Ah dude I really would have liked to
But I’m going away with faiths family from the 11th -13th"
You going to data science?,"Nah don’t think so
This weather isn’t it
Are you?"
Yeah,"You rate I should ?
Is it the ethics week?"
"Idk how they are gonna do this week
I feel like it’s gonna be compulsory like last year","How was the class?
Interesting?"
"I figured out what imma do for the project
Im calm now",What you gonna do?
"Feel like math is more important
Are you planning on going?
Ill let you know closer to the time","But even though it’ll probably be interesting, I feel like it’s not gonna be that beneficial in terms of work this semester
Do you think they ask questions about it in a2"
The severe lack of a Nicholas in class suggests you not coming,"No way
My WiFi is acting up
I would have actually come
Damn"
"Tf you mean no way  you were considering it just like an hour ago
Oh well",My bad
Ill send you my notes,Thanks pookie
"I didnt make any lol
Just learn what a hippocratic oath is","What model you working on ?
Linear ?
I need your opinion on something"
"But ik you dont ask serious questions
So it’s not
What do you wanna know","Don’t know if I should be offended by that
This isn’t constant variation of error term
But don’t know if it’s serious enough to do weighted least squares regression
And the model has a high r2 already
I’ve already done log transformation
On sales
Because there was serious heteroscedacity
And now this is after it. I’ve been through hours of searching to find the answer of the past few days
I don’t really know what best"
Have you tried doing weighted least squares regression yet?,You rate I just try and see?
"The thing is, i feel like it should really just have that tendency of bouncing around 0
But theres clearly a pattern
And the pattern is there even if you don’t overanalyse
So i really think thats not a good sign 
Damn tho that linear model you’re building is crazyyyy","I’ll try it out tmrw and then show you
Keep me up to date with what you doing to
I’m interested to see what you cooking up"
"Okay of course
Im doing gradient boosting rn and it seems very promising
Idk how the neural networks are shaping up tho",Have we done it before in class?
"Using it is so easy but understanding what it does is so insanely difficult
And they use it for so much more than just the types of data stuff we do",Damn that’s sick
What,"In data processing
It’s in linear regression
Look at the spec
Am I wrong?
Ok might be wrong"
"Yes
Logged","Damn
Crazy
No that’s normal
Look at overleaf
I have a qq plot for mine
Looks the same
How’s you get it to that?"
Why is overleaf broken,Sometimes refreshing fixes all problems
Can you compile?,"Yeah
Refresh
And clear cache"
"You genius
Refreshing worked",But yeah refreshing works
"Im gonna be so real
This Jean guy really isnt doing much  like have you read his descriptions for his EDA graphs and stuff","Bro
I couldn’t agree more
He’s done nothing lol
For this project
All he’s done is neural network which he hasn’t put much effort into"
"Yeah idrk what to do about it
I mean, read what he wrote for the correlation table. And HOW he wrote it. It’s like he tried to finish it in 10 seconds
If anything he’s costing us marks","First time I’ve read it
Damn
Horrible
Like 80% of what he said is incorrect
Why would numprevorders and profileinmonths be interaction term
We can just give him a low mark for work in that review thing
Nothing else to do sadly"
"We can jump in and try to fix it when he thinks we’re submitting
Oh btw
I think it might be a good idea for you to add that graph that shows how social media effects new visitors
Even though it might not effect sales, it’s much better than that correlation table tbh
I mean EVERYONE is gonna have that table
And the smart people will know to not include it cuz it doesnt tell us anything",We should joint a kaggle competition in the holidays
"I 100% agree
I updated the reference list to look like a citation thing","Damn luke
The reference list look insane
So sick"
"Sorry for not coming  I was late because something came up
So i just went into my venue",Just kidding
"2018 nicholas made the username young gravy
Thats crazy
As in the rapper?","Yeah lol
Why?
Jean actually picked up his game a little bit
His last section looks decent"
Im so cooked,Why?
"You can just send it on discord
Nicholas
I have a problem
He used tensorflow for his decision forests. Tensorflow is 600mb - i dont have space. I need to run his code in order to write interpretations of all the graphs and tables he made
So should I ask him to write it? ",It’s his job
"He wrote asjusted r swuared as the metric but we barely use adjusted for anything 
Brooooo i hate this so much
Where u","Thanks for putting in a lot of work luke
Let me know if I can do anything else to help
I fixed the Eda descriptions
For all the other ones than yours
I’ve also decided to Jean like 9 or 8 out of 10 for the teamwork rating thing
Figured there’s no point in ranking down since we have nothing to gain"
"Like the lack of references in his sections, how simple his graphs are, etc.","The only issue is what if they take it more serious
And then look into it
I don’t really know how it works
The concluding remarks is sick by the way. Nicely done"
"Nick can i ask you a favour
Could you maybe do the rubric thing we have to do","What is it?
What do you have to do?"
"The excel rubric has to be completed for each group
So you basically just mark the project","Does it say this in the projects spec so I can find it
And then yeah I’ll do it"
"It’s on the project rubric itself
At the top of the page","Surely Jean could do this
Does it matter what mark you give yourself
I’ll tell him to do it"
"Okay
Hows compsci going?",You?
One sec,Kk
Teamwork,Yeah I did the same pretty much
You happy with all the compsci stuff?,"Yeah I did better than I thought I would
You?"
"Yeah typechecking kinda screwed me over lol
But codegen is fine",What’d you get for type checking?
Where,"Under topic 3
I’m just talking about starting studying for a2
There isn’t any homework or anything"
Oh ,My bad
"Yeah thats whats been done in class im pretty sure
Im busy with it rn","Just working through the notes?
I’m gonna do the same"
Yep,Ok nice how far you?
"And also all the code and atuff
Im halfway through vector calculus
It’s a lot of revision from math 214 with some added stuff for vectors so it’s quite easy to grasp
And then theres the code too","Which project did you get to mark ?
For the peer review
I got group 5 and there’s is pretty stinky
Made me feel better about ours"
Bro how we gonna memorise all this ,"What you talking about?
Data science?
I haven’t done much work today 
Much needed break"
Yes. Im not tryna complain but like damn this is an entire math course,"Shit
Is it new stuff?"
You going to compsci today?,"Nah don’t think so
Pretty sure he’s used all his tests"
 you think so?,Isn’t it 8 including homework?
"Ohhhh
I have no idea","Fair me neither
I was told that too"
"But anyway im not going either
Just wanted to make sure","Have you started on the assembly tuts?
As in the one for marks"
Is the one for marks out already?,"Yeah I think
Tut 6 and 7
Like 90% sure those are the ones for marks"
"Oh yeah
Probably
im not in the mood for this bullshit im ngl
Im so over all this compsci stuff
Im just doing data science rn
Ill start with the compsci tomorrow","I’m done with comp sci
So sick of it
There’s just so much info in the notes"
"Yessir
Thank you for your effort
Much better than I expected, but she marked very strictly","I costed a little in the linear regression marks wise
But I feel like her marking was a little unfair in that section"
"Make sure you study the vector calculus stuff really hard
All the proofs and everything
Rest of the test is super easy","Thanks pookie
I will do that
How’s the rest of exams ?
You still down to do that 3d printing thing ?"
"Yes of course
Hby? How was stats?","Dude why didn’t you tell me
What type of problems ?"
Digestive issues and pain and allat. But i think it mostly stems from anxiety  Idk. It sucks,"How many exams you have left?
Would give me a chilled semester next year"
Im sure you’ll do fine though. Maybe you’ll get exactly 50 like Albert last semester,"But not sure 
But we’ll see
When you writing next?"
"Yooooo nick
Just wanna say I hope you have a good holiday and all that
Ik it sounds weird to say this out of the blue but i have a lot of respect for you and the way you go about life
Will definitely be working on projects with you","Much respect for you
How was operations research?"
"Ye for like 3 seconds
And you",Or didn’t write?
"I left after you
Cuz me and dylan exited at the same time and he said you left a minute ago
So","I never see you in person luke
You mysterious"
"Nicholas
I have an etiquette question for you
Imagine that your friend is celebrating his bday with you and a group of other friends at a music festival. You want to take Faith with you and she’ll be the only girl there. You cant order an uber, so one of you will have to be designated driver, which means someone cant drink. ","Hmm
Let me think
How long you know this girl?"
What girl ,"What is this for
Is this just a hypothetical
Or related to you somehow"
Im debating someone who was in the same situation so im making a hypothetical scenario to see what other people think,"But I feel like it’s specific to the relationship you have
Because I know faith would generally be happy to do it
But I wouldn’t get shit faced and would stay with her the entire time"
Ok thats valid,What’d you say

Why did you go?","So had to go do that
Very annoying"
"Hey Nicholas
I know youve done this a year ago but where tf do i see what my economics group is
I cant find it anywhere","Erm
Economics groups are impossible to find
I’ll look if I still am on it
Our 214 group changed to 244
So must be a new different group"
"Did you find econ classes useful or nah
Im not lus to be in class bro fr
Like even mathstats im skipping for the first few","Bro
I’m not going to any this year
They such a waste
All of them"
Lmk how you plan on extending your year and everything,yeah will do. going to plan it a little bit later tonight
"Look Nick turned off his caps now too 
Hahahaha","lol nah

would never stoop to that level"
"Agreed
Mine was off first year but my afro made me that way","makes sense

"Hey Nicholas
Just wanna ask how your A1s and projects and all that are looking for the next few weeks
Wanna get a beer with you at some point

So will do those next year"
"Im quite scared cuz im gonna have that full work load next year 
And i cant extend since im already staying a year extra","Bro
You should try convince your dad
Can start working to make up the difference cost wise
I do think you’ll be able to do it anyways"
"But I dont wanna stay another year though 
Like damn I need to GET OUT THERE
Nick I think maybe only you and me should go for the beers  I wanna talk to you about work  and projects  and building a cv
Cuz this time im not bartending lol","you let me know when

"Nicholas
Did macroeconomics have roll call for you too? I see thats what the introduction slides say but it doesnt say how it affects you being absent",Nah they didn’t
"Did u study from the textbook too or did u go to class
Also good luck with ur A1 today mr mostert","Because I couldn’t get the text book anywhere
Couldn’t plagiarises it
But not worth it if you can get the book"
"Hm
Yeah the macroeconomics uses a different textbook but ive been able to find it too","Ohhh yes I forgot it was split between macro and micro
Yes I got the macro book and didn’t go to class
But I went for the micro section"
Can u remember if the central limit theorem proof was examinable in 214,"shit sorry didn't see the message, was grafting for math stats
I don't really remember if I'm being honest, but if I were to guess, I don't think it is"
"Really good actually
I know all the proofs for the first time in my life lmao","lol
Proud of you"
Of course your test case simpl file must be in the same directory or you must specify the directory it is in,"ohhhh thank you!! that makes sense. I wasnt running testscanner on its own, i was trying to run 'make testscanner' and then couldnt figure out how to add a test case to test
you're a lifesaver"
"No problem it took me ages to figure it out, still trying to figure it all out",bro its insane; this project is going to ruin me. if you have any question feel free to ask me... cant guarantee ill know anything though

"Hi Nicholas. Hope you’re feeling okay and that your recovery is going well. Just to let you know that we decided to leave the scullery door open and give the boys  access to the house (just closed some upstairs rooms). Also, we noticed ants on the windowsill so used chalk to hopefully deter them. The chalk is in the dustbin with the cat food if you need to use it ","Hi Nicola, filled up the food bowls and the water bowl. No sign of any ants. Gave clover lots of attention. Didn’t see the other cats
Will be back tomorrow"
Thank you SO much - really appreciate what you are doing and especially the extra time you spend with Clover ,"Hi Nicola, just got back. One of the food bowls had ants in it so cleaned it out, washed it and then filled it again. I reapplied the chalk as well to hopefully stop them from coming back. Didn’t see the other cats. Clover was very talkative :)"
"Thank you!! If ever the water is off, you can use the hose pipe from the tank (rain water) ",No ants today. All good :)

The italics on her message are mine...she is lonely.",Ok cool. I’ll message her in the next few days 
Hi Nic...have not heard from you...are you OK?,"Oh sorry nana, had a very busy weekend in Cape Town so it skipped my mind to respond. We haven’t had a chance yet to contact Erin, faith and I have both been to busy to do anything outside of uni.
The job shadowing was cool but a bit of a waste of time since it was at an accounting department. Still glad I went though, I learnt a lot from it"
Awesome Nic,Faith says happy birthday 
Morning Nic....how are the studies going....and more importantly...how are you?....and how is Faith? Did you read the message I sent you on the Peregrino WhatsApp?,"Hi Nana, yes I did. Sorry just been very busy recently so couldn’t get around to responding. I’ve been good thanks, just under a lot of pressure from uni. How’re you?"
"Hi Nic...hope start of studies are going well. This is the workbench. It comes with the electric grinder, but minus the red clamp on the right hand side. Do you still want it?",Sorry nana I’m in class at the moment so can’t answer. Definitely am interested but I doubt I’ll be able to get it to stellenbosch. Would it be possible to take it at a later stage if you guys still have it?

"Hi Nic, still completely out of it
Can we do a double on Tuesday and a double on Wednesday. That way you can get answers to all your questions before the A2
I know its not ideal so alternatively I can arrange for one of my buddies to take you for a lesson or two before that date aswell if you would like","No no that works actually would be nice doing it right before as a revision type thing. Sorry you still not feeling good, hope you start feeling better soon!"
"Thanks, ok perfect. See you on Tuesday and Wednesday",I’m writing comp sci at 14:00 tomorrow. I’m free the rest of the day. What time works best for you?
Hi Nic will 8-10pm work,"On Wednesday could we do error estimation. Mainly just on crude error of estimation bound
And then an example or 2 of binomial approximation. I’m struggling to identify which approximation to use between the 2 options"
"Hi Nic, I havent had a chance to look at the questions you wanted",Yeah that works
Check you at 5pm again?,Sounds good
Im going to find examples of approximation for normal and binomial by tonight. Ill write them out on my iPad and send it to you on pdf rather than doing the lesson at 5pm. Will try my best to send it through by tonight,"Nah no stress. I understand the binomial approximation now. The only thing I really am not sure of is random variable transformations where u splits into more than one eqn.
I’ll try find an example and then even if we don’t do a call, could you answer the question and explain how you determine if it needs to be separated? If not no stress"
Ill try ny best to get it to you by tonight or latest before 6am tomorrow,"I got that 1/2 < u < 1 but not sure how they got 0 < u< 1/2 and why they’re seperate
If that makes sense?"
"put the hashtable into testsy....

The second part is what I usually do. But push your leg sideways more than what he is Then it will do a little pop
And you’ll be all fixed
But I think it’s just your hip that’s out of place
Needs to be popped back in
If you do it right then your lower back/hip will click","that's me

"Hi Nic. Spoke to Joe Van Niekerk today being Max's father. He has sent me his work email and asked that you and Faith send him your cvs. He mentioned in passing that he knows the best IT company in RSA but I have forgotten their name but assume that they service Discovery. He is, I assume, suggesting that if you impress, he could make an introduction with this company. I am not sure if this relates to this vac or later or whether it relates also to Faith, but I think it depends on your performance. I think you and Faith must do full vc's with testimonials, matric and other results. Mom and I will obviously help you guys.",Flip that’s awesome thank you dad. Maybe we can call soon to catch up and talk about it??
"Hi Nic. I want to start taking Creatine. Can you suggest a brand and dose etc. And where can I buy it.
Hope your studying is going well.",And then also make sure you drink enough water

"Predictors = model =
Meaning that the different models will show an increased divergence from each other dependent on their features","Sampling features results in even more predictor diversity, trading a bit more bias for a lower variance."

P1
You?"
"I don't believe it needs to be adapted
It basically just pushes true or false onto the stack given the expression
I use use it only in parse_expr",I think my code is buggy somewhere else
are you having a problem where it always evaluates to true?,Yeah
"interesting, I have just encountered that issue","I figured my main issue is because in a if statement if it’s a comparison between and int and an identifier that’s an int, it’s not loading the identifier value properly
But I’m really not sure"
"gonna look for this issue, will let you know if i find it","I’ve got mine working
It was gen_2_label
I can send mine to you if you want?
Or just explain what I had to change"

code[ip].type = CODE_LABEL | CODE_OPERAND;
CODE_OPERAND was missing
did you do that too?
hell yeah
team work
sorta",I hate how one little thing like that can take so long to fix 
"i wonder how many people had this issue haha
took me way too long to check the bytecode cause that answered everything
I think understanding whats going on is the hardest part, and thats been harder than all the other hand ins except maybe typechecking
but the implementation is relatively quick i think, debugging is just trippy
that is, once you've figured out whats going on","Do you by any chance also have a problem where for example in your simpl file
Obviously no rush to respond, just curious if you having this too"

"Idk maybe
But I can’t fucking sleep I woke up today at 1-2 pm",Shit that’s horrible
Yeah,"I think best bet is if you go to a doctor, tell them you struggling and then they’ll give a a prescription for string sleeping tablets
And then you use that to help fix your sleep
That’s what I had to do"
"How’d you do for LA
And please tell me how to study for it in the most time effective way
Cause I’ve only been doing AC

Made the most sense"
Horrible so bad,"Damn
Dylan also said it was crazy hard
How you feeling for the one tomorrow

But I like like well fleshed out notes a girl made on her ipad
So
I’m making good time now since I found this one YT channel I haven’t touched the textbook
I finished chapter 4 in 2 hrs and half of chapter 5 in 1. My plan is. Finish Chapter 5 & 9 today and just do macro exam questions because Ecos exams are so diff from theory","But I don’t think we gonna get that

Sorry for late reply was debugging,And how’s ecos going??
"Yo Nic

The only thing is you need a car if your further out of stellies"
"Okay cool
Yeah I’m tryna convince Josh and maps to move or of stellies w me",Just have to keep looking at property 24 and all the websites
"It’s becoming a choice of choosing quality of life over being close to campus
Like the rents too high","That’s why I’m moving
It’s not worth it anymore
Rents gone up like 2k in the last 2 years"
"We can submit an essay multiple times right, just to check out the plagiarism score?",Apparently you can

How you feeling about the paper?"
"Not confident at all
I don’t even wanna write it
But I don’t wanna stay here until end of November either
It’s weird because it’s not like the other Ecos modules. This is just straight theory, no graphs nothing
No real calculations
Imma just try and pass this paper and do better in the A2",Goodluck bb
"How do you feel
Easy distinc","Nah lol
Got math stats tmrw
And comp sci hand in tmrw
Ecos low priority
Low-key cooked"
Damn did you just read the stuff,"I read it a lot of times though
Been reading over the stuff since the beginning of the Holliday"

I wish there was more practical stuff
Like calculations"
"Yo man, do you by chance have the chess game project from last year
I can’t recall how to implement GUI and so all that stuff with tKinter . That’s literally all I have to do now

They just have been nice with the marking for a1

"How was it ?
I didn’t like it tbh
Trade wasn’t bad but Monetary was sketch",Writing a3 instead
"I really wish i did that  but I alr booked my flight and mentally prepped myself to go home asap
For some reason they focused so much on earlier stuff and so little on the rest
There was one question dedicated to CBs and then the rest were all like earlier chapters
Barely anything to do w like the good stuff like money supply and exchange rates",So you don’t rate it’s worth it to focus on past papers?
Yup,You done with exams?

"Hey Nic! It’s Sam (your cuzzie!). I need some advice.. I want to send my little man to Bennies, but Emile is a KES old boy Not keen on government and I think Bennies would be a good fit. Emile seems to think the school won’t be sporty enough. Now I know you were super sporty.. would you say KES is a better school in terms of sport?
Sorry.. trying hard over here to convince Emile that Bennies is just as good!","Hi Sam, hope you’ve been well!! "
